**[PRESENTER PREPARATION NOTE: Before starting the meeting, check that your screenshare works, slides 0-9 are loaded and ready, microphone is unmuted, and camera is positioned appropriately. Have a backup plan - if your screen freezes, quickly stop and restart the share. If your audio cuts out, check your Teams audio settings and reconnect. Use the Teams chat for audience questions. REHEARSE TOGETHER to keep this under 15 minutes - aim for 14 minutes to have buffer time. Be energetic but natural!]**

**[Total Time: ~14 minutes]**

## ANGELO: Introduction and Methodology (3 minutes)

**(Start screenshare with Slide 1: Title Slide)** **Angelo:** Hi everyone! I'm Angelo Manalo, and I'm joined today by my teammates Gio, Vinz, and Artainian. We're FEU Tech students presenting our "Usability Analysis of Amazon's E-Commerce Platform." This study is for our Human-Computer Interaction course under Prof. Marilyn Sanchez.

**(Switch to Slide 2: "Why Amazon?")** **Angelo:** So why did we focus on Amazon? First, it's a global e-commerce giant used by millions every day—you can see their iconic delivery truck here. Second, we wanted to evaluate their platform's usability and suggest improvements. Even small interface issues can drive customers away, potentially costing Amazon millions in lost sales.

**(Ask audience: "How many of you have abandoned an online purchase because the website was frustrating to use?")**

**(Switch to Slide 3: "How We Did It")** **Angelo:** Here's our research approach. We used a mixed-methods design with two main components. First, we surveyed 13 college students aged 18-22, asking them to rate Amazon's layout, navigation ease, and overall satisfaction. Our target was a System Usability Scale score of 80 out of 100—the industry benchmark for good usability. Second, we conducted usability testing, tracking metrics like success rates, completion times, and error counts as users performed common tasks like searching for products and checking out.

**(Transition)** Now I'll hand it over to Gio, who will walk you through what we discovered.

## GIO: Key Findings (3.5 minutes)

**(Start screenshare with Slide 4: "What We Found")** **Gio:** Thanks, Angelo! I'm Gio Panopio, and I'll be sharing our key findings. As you can see in this visual of data analysis, Amazon has clear strengths but also important challenges to address. The platform excels in three areas: intuitive layout, effective recommendations, and secure transactions. However, we found persistent issues with interface clutter, navigation difficulties, and delivery problems.

**(Switch to Slide 5: "Interface and Navigation")** **Gio:** Looking at interface and navigation specifically, 84.6% of participants found Amazon's layout intuitive, as shown by this user with a tablet. Usability testing confirmed this, with 85% of users successfully completing their tasks. However, 38.5% complained about excessive clutter, and 25% struggled with filtering options when searching for products.

**(Switch to Slide 6: "Search and Recommendations")** **Gio:** For search functionality and recommendations, 84.6% rated Amazon's recommendation system as effective. That's impressive! Still, we found that 7.7% of users couldn't locate specific items even when using search, and interestingly, 35% preferred browsing by category rather than using the search bar—suggesting potential improvements for search functionality.

**(Switch to Slide 7: "Checkout and Security")** **Gio:** Regarding checkout and security—symbolized here by the phone, lock, and package—84.6% of users felt secure during transactions. This is crucial for e-commerce. Yet 15.4% reported feeling insecure, and 40% expressed confusion about delivery options during checkout.

**(Switch to Slide 8: "Delivery")** **Gio:** Looking at delivery experiences—represented by the truck and packages—84.6% were satisfied with Amazon's delivery speed, but 23.1% reported delays as a significant issue.

**(Switch to Slide 9: "Overall Scores")** **Gio:** Overall, satisfaction averaged 2.08 out of 3, the Net Promoter Score came in at 15.5, and the System Usability Scale score reached 74 out of 100—falling below our target of 80.

**(Transition)** Now I'll pass it to Vinz, who will explain why these findings matter from a design perspective.

## VINZ: Discussion and Analysis (3.5 minutes)

**(Start screenshare with Slide 4: "What We Found")** **Vinz:** Thank you, Gio! I'm Vinz Angelo De Guzman. I'll connect our findings to fundamental design principles and explain why they matter. Starting with this overview slide, the strengths Gio mentioned demonstrate good design in many areas, but the challenges indicate specific design principles being violated.

**(Switch to Slide 5: "Interface and Navigation")** **Vinz:** The interface clutter reported by 38.5% of users directly violates Nielsen's "Aesthetic and Minimalist Design" heuristic. When users feel overwhelmed by ads and options, they get distracted from their primary task—finding and purchasing products. We've classified this as a high-priority issue because it directly impacts user efficiency.

**(Ask audience: "Have you ever felt overwhelmed by too much information when shopping online?")**

**(Switch to Slide 6: "Search and Recommendations")** **Vinz:** Navigation issues, like the 25% who struggled with filters, contradict the principle of "Recognition Rather Than Recall." Users shouldn't have to remember where features are hidden—they should be able to recognize them instantly. This is a medium-priority issue because experienced users eventually adapt, but it still slows down the shopping process.

**(Switch to Slide 7: "Checkout and Security")** **Vinz:** The 15.4% of users who felt insecure during checkout highlights a critical breach of "Trust and Credibility" principles. In e-commerce, perceived security is everything—if users don't trust your platform with their credit card, they won't complete purchases. This is our most severe issue, despite affecting fewer users.

**(Switch to Slide 8: "Delivery")** **Vinz:** Finally, the 23.1% who experienced delivery delays relates to the "Visibility of System Status" principle. Users need clear, transparent updates about where their packages are and when they'll arrive. We've marked this as high-priority because it affects the entire post-purchase experience.

**(Transition)** Now Artainian will share our recommendations for addressing these issues.

## ARTAINIAN: Recommendations and Conclusion (4 minutes)

**(Start screenshare with Slide 10: "Recommendations")** **Artainian:** Thanks, Vinz! I'm Artainian Abulencia, and I'll outline our practical solutions—represented by this checklist on screen. Our recommendations directly address the usability issues we identified:

First, to tackle the interface clutter reported by 38.5% of users, we recommend increasing white space, simplifying menu structures, and allowing users to customize ad visibility. This could potentially reduce product search time by 20%.

Second, addressing the 15.4% who felt insecure during transactions, we suggest prominently displaying security certifications throughout the checkout process and enhancing scam detection for third-party sellers. This could reduce "insecure" ratings to below 5%.

Third, for the 23.1% who experienced delivery issues, we recommend implementing more accurate delivery estimates using data analytics and providing more frequent tracking updates. The goal would be to achieve 95% on-time delivery and boost overall satisfaction.

**(Show enthusiasm)** Implementing these changes could significantly improve Amazon's usability scores and ultimately increase customer loyalty and sales!

**(Switch to Slide 1: Title Slide)** **Artainian:** To conclude, Amazon's platform excels in many areas, particularly layout intuitiveness, recommendation effectiveness, and transaction security. However, addressing the issues we've identified—especially interface clutter, security perceptions, and delivery transparency—would elevate the user experience to new heights.

For future research, we recommend expanding the participant pool beyond college students and conducting longitudinal studies to track how changes impact usability over time.

**(End screenshare)** **Artainian:** Thank you for your attention! We're happy to answer any questions about our analysis or recommendations.
