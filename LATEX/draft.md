## Abstract  
This study assesses the usability of Amazon's e-commerce platform through a mixed-methods approach, integrating survey data from 13 participants[^1] and usability testing results[^2]. Findings indicate that Amazon excels in layout intuitiveness (84.6% positive ratings[^1]), recommendation effectiveness (84.6%[^1]), and transaction security perceptions (84.6%[^1]), yet struggles with interface clutter, navigation challenges, and delivery concerns. Quantitative metrics, such as an average satisfaction score of 2.08/3[^1] and a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 15.5[^1], suggest moderate user satisfaction with potential for enhancement. The System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 74/100[^2] fell below the target of 80/100, indicating room for improvement. Recommendations include reducing visual clutter, improving search functionality, and enhancing delivery communication to elevate the overall user experience.

## Introduction  
Usability is a cornerstone of successful e-commerce platforms, directly impacting user satisfaction, retention, and business performance. As a leader in online retail, Amazon's website serves millions daily, making its usability a critical factor in maintaining competitive advantage. This study investigates Amazon's user experience by analyzing survey data[^1] and usability testing results[^2], focusing on interface design, navigation, search functionality, checkout processes, and delivery experiences.  

The research originated from an HCI course project outlined in the project guidelines[^3], where we were tasked with analyzing provided survey data[^1] and a usability study report[^2] on Amazon's website, identifying usability issues, and proposing improvements based on HCI principles. This paper consolidates those efforts, offering a detailed evaluation and actionable recommendations to enhance Amazon's usability for its diverse user base.

## Methodology  
A mixed-methods approach was employed to comprehensively evaluate Amazon's usability, combining quantitative survey data[^1] and qualitative usability testing insights[^2].

### Survey Design  
The survey collected responses from 13 participants—primarily students aged 18-22—on various usability aspects[^1]:  
- **Quantitative Metrics:** Ratings for layout intuitiveness, navigation ease, overall satisfaction (1-3 scale), recommendation likelihood (1-4 scale), and security perceptions.  
- **Qualitative Feedback:** Open-ended comments on challenges and improvement suggestions.  

### Usability Testing  
Usability testing assessed user interactions with Amazon's desktop and mobile web interfaces through tasks such as[^2]:  
- Locating and purchasing a product  
- Navigating to deals and managing the cart  
- Completing checkout  
- Comparing products  
- Updating account preferences  

Key metrics included task completion rates, time on task, error rates, and satisfaction scores, with a target System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 80/100 as a benchmark for good usability[^2].

## Findings  
The analysis revealed Amazon's usability strengths and areas needing improvement, supported by both survey data[^1] and usability testing outcomes[^2].

### User Interface and Navigation  
- **Strengths:** 84.6% of participants rated the layout as "Intuitive" or "Very Intuitive," and 84.6% found product location "Easy" or "Very Easy"[^1]. In usability testing, the task of finding and purchasing a specific product had an 85% success rate, with an average completion time of 3.2 minutes[^2].  
- **Challenges:** 38.5% reported interface clutter and excessive advertisements as significant issues, with comments like "UI is very cluttered"[^1]. Usability testing showed that 25% of users struggled with filtering options during product search[^2]. Navigation difficulties, such as accessing the cart, were also noted[^1].

**Table 1: User Ratings for Interface and Navigation**

| Aspect                | Very Positive         | Positive             | Negative             |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Layout Intuitiveness  | Very Intuitive: 15.4% | Intuitive: 69.2%     | Unintuitive: 15.4%   |
| Product Location      | Very Easy: 15.4%      | Easy: 69.2%          | Difficult: 15.4%     |

### Product Search and Information Architecture  
- **Strengths:** 84.6% rated recommendations and customer reviews as "Effective" or "Very Effective"[^1].  
- **Challenges:** 7.7% struggled to find specific items, with one participant suggesting "better indicators for sold-out products"[^1]. Usability testing revealed that 35% of users relied on category navigation rather than search, indicating potential search inefficiencies[^2].

### Transaction Security and Checkout  
- **Strengths:** 84.6% felt "Secure" or "Very Secure" during transactions[^1].  
- **Challenges:** 15.4% reported feeling "Insecure," posing a risk to trust and conversion rates[^1]. During usability testing, 80% of participants completed the checkout process without assistance, but 40% were confused by multiple delivery options[^2].

### Delivery Experience  
- **Strengths:** 84.6% were "Satisfied" or "Very Satisfied" with delivery speed[^1].  
- **Challenges:** 23.1% highlighted delivery delays, with one noting "late deliveries" as a recurring issue[^1].

### Overall Satisfaction and Loyalty  
- **Satisfaction:** Average score of 2.08/3, indicating moderate satisfaction[^1].  
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Calculated at 15.5 (Promoters: 38.5%, Detractors: 23.1%), suggesting positive but improvable user advocacy[^1].  
- **System Usability Scale (SUS):** The overall SUS score was 74/100, falling short of the target of 80/100[^2].

**Table 2: Satisfaction and Recommendation Distribution**

| Metric            | 1 (Best) | 2       | 3       | 4 (Worst) |
|-------------------|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Satisfaction      | 23.1%    | 46.1%   | 30.8%   | -         |
| Recommend Likelihood | 38.5% | 38.5%   | 7.7%    | 15.4%     |

## Discussion  
The findings highlight usability issues that violate key HCI principles[^4], providing a framework for understanding their impact on user experience.

### Interface Clutter and Advertisements  
- **Issue:** 38.5% of participants found the interface cluttered due to ads[^1].  
- **HCI Principle:** Violates Nielsen's *Aesthetic and Minimalist Design* heuristic[^4], overwhelming users with non-essential content.  
- **Severity:** High (P1) – frequent complaints disrupt task efficiency.

### Navigation and Search Functionality  
- **Issue:** Challenges in locating products and accessing the cart[^1].  
- **HCI Principle:** Contravenes *Recognition Rather Than Recall*[^4], requiring users to remember pathways rather than recognize them.  
- **Severity:** Medium (P2) – impacts efficiency but mitigated by familiarity.

### Security Perceptions  
- **Issue:** 15.4% felt insecure during transactions[^1].  
- **HCI Principle:** Undermines *Trust and Credibility*, essential for e-commerce platforms.  
- **Severity:** Critical (P0) – low frequency but high impact on user trust.

### Delivery Concerns  
- **Issue:** 23.1% reported delivery delays as a major issue[^1].  
- **HCI Principle:** Affects *Visibility of System Status*[^4], leaving users uncertain about order progress.  
- **Severity:** High (P1) – influences post-purchase satisfaction and loyalty.

## Conclusion  
Amazon's platform demonstrates significant usability strengths in layout intuitiveness, recommendations, and security, yet faces critical challenges with interface clutter (P1), delivery delays (P1), and security perceptions (P0). Implementing the proposed recommendations—such as decluttering the interface, enhancing search capabilities, and improving delivery transparency—can elevate user satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately benefiting business outcomes. Future research should expand participant diversity and incorporate longitudinal metrics to further validate these insights.
