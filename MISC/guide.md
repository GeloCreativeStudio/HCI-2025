# HCI Final Project: "Usability Testing of a Website or App"

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive usability testing study on an existing website or mobile application. Students will evaluate the user experience, identify usability issues, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement. This project will help students apply HCI principles and usability testing methodologies in a real-world context.

## Objectives

1. **Select a Website or App.** Choose an existing website or mobile application that requires usability testing.
2. **Define Usability Goals.** Establish specific usability goals and metrics to evaluate the user experience.
3. **Conduct User Research.** Gather information about the target users and their needs.
4. **Plan and Execute Usability Testing.** Design a usability testing plan, recruit participants, and conduct tests.
5. **Analyze Results.** Analyze the data collected during testing to identify usability issues.
6. **Provide Recommendations.** Develop a report with findings and actionable recommendations for improving usability.

## Project Phases

### 1. Selection of Website or App (Week 1)
- Choose a website or mobile application that is relevant and has a user base. Examples could include e-commerce sites, educational platforms, or health apps.
- Obtain permission to conduct usability testing if necessary.

### 2. Define Usability Goals (Week 2)
- Establish specific usability goals based on the chosen website or app. Goals may include:
  - Task completion rate
  - Time on task
  - User satisfaction ratings
  - Error rate
- Identify key tasks that users typically perform on the site or app.

### 3. User Research (Week 3)
- Conduct surveys or interviews to understand the target users, their demographics, and their expectations.
- Create user personas to represent the different types of users who will interact with the website or app.

### 4. Usability Testing Plan (Week 4)
- Design a usability testing plan that includes:
  - Test objectives
  - Participant recruitment criteria
  - Testing methods (e.g., moderated vs. unmoderated testing, remote vs. in-person)
  - Task scenarios for participants to complete during the test
- Prepare testing materials, including consent forms, task scripts, and questionnaires.

### 5. Conduct Usability Testing (Week 5)
- Recruit participants that match the user personas.
- Conduct usability tests, observing participants as they complete tasks. Record their interactions, comments, and any difficulties they encounter.
- Collect quantitative data (e.g., time on task, success rate) and qualitative data (e.g., user feedback).

### 6. Analyze Results (Week 6)
- Analyze the data collected during usability testing to identify patterns and usability issues.
- Use metrics to evaluate the usability goals defined earlier.
- Summarize findings in a clear and organized manner.

### 7. Develop Recommendations (Week 7)
- Based on the analysis, create a report that includes:
  - A summary of usability issues identified
  - Recommendations for improving the user experience
  - Prioritization of issues based on severity and impact
- Prepare a presentation to share findings with the class.

### 8. Final Presentation (Week 8)
- Present the project to classmates and faculty, including:
  - Overview of the selected website or app
  - Usability goals and research findings
  - Methodology and results of usability testing
  - Key recommendations for improvement
- Highlight the importance of usability testing in the design process.

## Evaluation Criteria

### HCI Final Project: Usability Evaluation Grading Matrix (100%)

| Criteria | Weight | Excellent (100-90%) | Good (89-75%) | Satisfactory (74-60%) | Needs Improvement (Below 60%) |
|----------|--------|---------------------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Clarity and Relevance of Usability Goals** | 20% | Goals are clearly defined, highly relevant, and align perfectly with user needs and project objectives. | Goals are mostly clear and relevant, with minor gaps in alignment. | Goals are somewhat clear but may lack specificity or full relevance. | Goals are unclear, vague, or not aligned with usability needs. |
| **Depth of User Research and Persona Development** | 20% | Comprehensive research with well-defined, realistic personas based on real user data. | Good research with reasonable personas, though some details may be missing. | Basic user research with personas lacking depth or supporting data. | Minimal research with generic or missing personas. |
| **Quality and Thoroughness of Usability Testing** | 20% | Testing is well-structured, includes diverse users, and follows proper methodologies. | Testing is conducted well but lacks some depth or variety in participants/methods. | Basic usability testing with limited scope or minor flaws. | Testing is poorly conducted, lacks structure, or has insufficient user feedback. |
| **Insightfulness of Analysis and Recommendations** | 20% | Analysis is deep, insightful, and leads to actionable, well-justified recommendations. | Good analysis with reasonable recommendations, though some areas need improvement. | Basic analysis with general recommendations lacking depth. | Analysis is weak or lacks meaningful recommendations. |
| **Clarity and Professionalism of Final Presentation** | 20% | Presentation is clear, professional, and effectively communicates findings with strong visuals and logical structure. | Presentation is well-structured and mostly professional but may have minor issues. | Presentation is understandable but lacks polish or effective communication. | Presentation is unclear, unprofessional, or difficult to follow. |

### Final Score Calculation

Total Score = (Sum of scores × Weight per category)
