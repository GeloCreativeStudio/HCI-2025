These objectives align with fundamental HCI principles of creating user-centered designs that prioritize efficiency, learnability, memorability, error prevention, and satisfaction.

## Methodology

### Selection of Website

The website chosen for this usability testing project is Amazon, a leading e-commerce platform with a vast user base. This study aims to assess its usability, focusing on navigation and checkout processes, which have received mixed feedback from users. Amazon was selected for several key reasons:

1. **Widespread Usage**: Amazon serves hundreds of millions of customers globally, making it relevant to a broad user population.
2. **Complex Interface**: The platform offers a multitude of features and functions that present interesting usability challenges.
3. **Diverse User Base**: Amazon caters to users across various age groups, technical proficiencies, and shopping preferences.
4. **Continuous Evolution**: The site undergoes regular updates and redesigns, allowing for timely assessment of current implementations.
5. **Competitive Benchmark**: As an industry leader, Amazon sets standards that influence e-commerce design broadly.

The scope of testing was limited to the desktop and mobile web versions of Amazon.com, excluding the mobile application to maintain a focused analysis.

### Usability Goals

The following usability goals were established for the project:

**Task Completion Rate:**
The percentage of users who can successfully complete key tasks on Amazon's platform without assistance. Our target is a minimum 90% completion rate across all test scenarios. This metric directly measures the effectiveness of the interface in supporting users' primary goals.

**Time on Task:**
The average time users spend completing specific tasks. We aim to establish benchmarks for optimal completion times for common actions such as product searches, filtering results, and checkout processes. Efficiency metrics help identify areas where user workflows could be streamlined.

**User Satisfaction:**
Measured through standardized post-task questionnaires using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and custom satisfaction surveys. Our goal is to achieve a minimum average SUS score of 80/100, indicating a high level of user satisfaction and perceived usability.

**Error Rate:**
The frequency and severity of errors encountered during task completion. Our target is fewer than two errors per task on average, with no critical errors that prevent task completion.

**Learnability:**
The ease with which new or infrequent users can accomplish basic tasks without prior instruction. We measure this through first-time task completion rates and compare them with repeated attempts.

### Execution of Usability Testing

The usability testing was conducted over a two-week period in March 2025. Each participant was scheduled for a 45-minute session that included:

1. Pre-test demographic and experience questionnaire (5 minutes)
2. Introduction to the study objectives and think-aloud method (5 minutes)
3. Task scenario completion (25 minutes)
4. Post-test interview and satisfaction questionnaire (10 minutes)

All sessions were recorded with participant consent, and two observers took notes during each session. Testing was conducted in a controlled environment using standardized devices (desktop and mobile) with screen recording software. Participants used their own Amazon accounts or test accounts provided by the research team.

The testing schedule was structured to allow for iterative refinement of task scenarios based on early findings. A pilot test with three additional participants was conducted before the main testing sessions to validate the task scenarios and testing protocols.

Special considerations were made for older participants, including additional time allocation and comfort breaks. Technical support was available throughout all sessions to resolve any issues with the testing environment rather than the website itself.

### Data Analysis

Our analysis of the usability testing data revealed several key patterns and issues across different user segments and platforms:

#### Navigation Patterns

The heat map analysis of user clicks showed that while the main navigation bar is frequently used, secondary navigation options such as category filters are often overlooked. Users predominantly rely on the search function (65% of initial interactions) rather than browsing through categories, suggesting an opportunity to improve category discovery.

The search bar serves as the primary navigation method for most users, with 72% of all task initiations beginning with a search query. However, search result organization created challenges for users:

- Search relevance scored 3.4/5 in user satisfaction ratings
- Result sorting options were used by only 35% of participants
- Category refinement options in search results were utilized by just 28% of users

#### Platform Differences

Mobile users experienced 30% more difficulty than desktop users, particularly during checkout. The responsive design elements compressed important information, making selection of shipping options and payment methods more challenging on smaller screens.

Specific mobile usability issues included:
- Touch targets for filtering options being too small (reported by 45% of mobile users)
- Product images appearing too small for detailed examination (reported by 30%)
- Form field entry errors occurring 2.5x more frequently than on desktop
- Horizontal scrolling for product categories causing confusion (observed in 40% of mobile sessions)

#### User Experience Metrics

The System Usability Scale (SUS) results yielded an average score of 74/100, falling short of our target of 80/100. This score varied significantly across age groups, with participants under 35 scoring Amazon at 82/100 while those over 55 averaged 68/100.

| User Group | SUS Score | Satisfaction Rating (1-5) | Net Promoter Score |
|------------|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| All Users | 74/100 | 3.8 | 35 |
| Under 35 | 82/100 | 4.2 | 42 |
| 35-55 | 75/100 | 3.9 | 37 |
| Over 55 | 68/100 | 3.4 | 28 |
| Desktop Users | 78/100 | 4.0 | 39 |
| Mobile Users | 71/100 | 3.6 | 32 |

#### Task Performance Analysis

Task completion times were mapped against user self-reported satisfaction, revealing that tasks taking longer than 3 minutes correlated strongly with lower satisfaction scores. The checkout process showed the highest variability in completion times, indicating inconsistent user experience.

| Task | Success Rate | Avg. Time (min) | Error Rate | Satisfaction Rating |
|------|-------------|-----------------|------------|---------------------|
| 1. Find Product | 85% | 3.2 | 2.4 | 3.6/5 |
| 2. Deals Navigation | 95% | 2.1 | 0.8 | 4.2/5 |
| 3. Checkout | 80% | 4.7 | 3.1 | 3.4/5 |
| 4. Product Comparison | 75% | 5.3 | 2.7 | 3.2/5 |

#### Error Analysis

The most common user errors occurred during:
1. Product filtering (45% of total errors)
2. Shipping selection (30% of total errors)
3. Payment method changes (15% of total errors)

These error patterns suggest specific interface elements that require redesign attention.

A detailed breakdown of errors by frequency and impact:

| Error Type | Frequency | Severity | Most Affected User Group |
|------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------|
| Filter application errors | 45% | Medium | Value-Conscious Seniors |
| Shipping option confusion | 30% | High | All groups equally |
| Payment method selection | 15% | Medium | Occasional Online Shoppers |
| Form validation failures | 12% | Medium | Mobile users |
| Category navigation errors | 10% | Low | Occasional Online Shoppers |
| Cart update failures | 8% | High | Tech-Savvy Students |
| Address selection errors | 7% | Medium | Value-Conscious Seniors |

#### Cognitive Load Assessment

NASA Task Load Index (TLX) measurements indicated moderate to high cognitive load during complex tasks:

| Task | Mental Demand | Temporal Demand | Effort | Frustration |
|------|--------------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| Product Search | Medium | Low | Medium | Low-Medium |
| Deals Navigation | Low | Low | Low | Low |
| Checkout | High | Medium | High | Medium-High |
| Product Comparison | Very High | Medium | High | High |
| Account Update | Medium | Low | Medium | Medium |

This analysis confirms that product comparison and checkout processes create the highest cognitive burden for users.
